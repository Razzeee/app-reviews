# Linux review stats

This repo tries to make some sense of the data the linux community has about their apps. Especially focusing on what we can learn from the reviews users write and how things can be improved.

## Getting started
See the `export` folder for instructions how to create the raw data.

Then check out the `stats.ipynb` to look at some statistics.

You can also just open that file on github to get a glimpse.
